* mesh and animation of dumbell:
A marching method for the triangulation of surfaces
This is my implementation of Fast marching algorithm in C++. Visualisation in in paraview see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeauohkflT0
Main meshing algorithm is from the article https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ae1e/216a99fb6943b122ba3d42041291f039f0d1.pdf
